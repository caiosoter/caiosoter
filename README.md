My name is Caio SÃ³ter and I am current an Electrical Engineering student at Federal University of Pernambuco. I have been switching careers to Data Science since I started working with python and Machine learning in the beginning of my undergraduation. I love solving problems using data and Machine Learning, especialy problems related to energy and electrical engineering.
